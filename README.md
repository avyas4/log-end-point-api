# LOG END POINT API

This is a simple javascript application to setup a local endpoint for your application using nodejs and express.

This is to setup the one end of a communication channel.

The endpoint API can be written into Java, Python, JavaScript, and C# depending on the project requirements and complexity of your project.

# Overview

Welcome to the Log end point api folder, a webapp built to setup the local endpoint for your log application.

This reads the `programming-task-example-data.log` file and returns it into the array of objects that can be call by any FED application.

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to run locally in your machine once you are in the `log-end-point-api` folder:
```
npm install
npm start
```
The application will be running on `http://localhost:8888/log` to verify the final result.

For additional information, node version `20.17.0` has been used to build this application.
